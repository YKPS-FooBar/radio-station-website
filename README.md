Radio Station website

## This is how it should work:
This website is a song chooser for next week. A week composes of four days, to wit, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday, when music will and can be played.

Each week we get to decide the songs for next week, although data for previous weeks should still be available.

The current plan for next week is shown on the home page alone with some QR codes and plans for past weeks and other links. The current plan is normally not editable before paying.

If you pay the money Â¥5.00 through WeChat, you will be directed to a form where you have to put in your Student ID/Contact method, in case of songs of inappropriate length (>5 min, in which case it will be cut short), of inappropriate content (well, like swear words), or of other reasons. If any of those cases happens, then Peter (head of the radio station) will contact the student and try to moderate, which will not be our business.

After filling out the form, we need to choose *one and only one* unoccupied cell to edit. Concurrent edits of a same cell should not happen. There should be autosaving for cell-editing in case the webpage is closed before clicking on a confirm/submit button.

The song can only be at most 5 minutes long. It is optional and recommended to upload the song as well, besides just entering the name. There will be a "notes" text area for you to send additional notes to Peter (e.g. if you want to truncate, please cut at 4.6 minutes; a link to the song; just thanks or thoughts for improvement).

Then, when another person goes to the home page, the formerly unoccupied cell should be edited and occupied.

There should be an admin portal for Peter to, for exmaple, edit songs in bulk (e.g. when it's a birthday of someone), delete songs, add songs, see who added which song, etc. It can also be used by us to debug.

~~I am so sleepy. I finished my Chinese essay.~~

In the case when someone wants to add a bunch of songs for a day or do something like a 6-minute song, the person will be directed to Peter via one of the QR codes, and Peter will do stuff accordingly, and that will become null of our business.

~~It is 1:30 a.m. Am I typing?~~
